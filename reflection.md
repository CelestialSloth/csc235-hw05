# Reflection
 
## Contributions
Liberty Lehr:
1. Coded reliability.ipynb
2. Sketched reliability.heic 
3. Wrote hypothesis 1a, 1b, 1c
4. Wrote recommendations 1, 2

Emi Neuwalder
1. Made arcGIS map of radiation sensor reports, and corresponding sketch.
2. Generated recommendations 3 and 4
3. Generated hypothesis 3

Elaine Demetrion
1. Coded compile_sensors.ipynb, which creates a dataframe with both the static and mobile sensors
2. Created a visualization of quake mentions on social media vs time by neighborhood (did not include in report)
3. Created a visualization of static sensor radiation readings over time (did not include in report)
4. Created a visualization of shake intensity reports by neighborhood over time (did not include in report)
5. Created a visualization of social media sentiment vs shake intensity vs damage
6. Wrote hypothesis 2
7. Compiled final submission

## Obstacle:
One obstacle we faced was combining the data to find interesting insights (as opposed to combining data to see that actually, two variables had little to do with each other). To overcome this, we focused on what could be gleaned from a lack of relationship.

## What we would do differently:
This assignment took a long time for us to submit, because despite having all of the visualizations completed relatively close to the initial due date, we were unable to find a time in our schedules to sit down and complete the report together. This led to over a month long delay. Were we to do this assignment again, we would have either submitted the report minus one visualization, or designated someone specific to complete the final section of the report on their own, and then have someone check and edit it (rather than trying to coordinate a meeting time).
